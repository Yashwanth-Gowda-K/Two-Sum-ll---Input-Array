# Two-Sum-ll---Input-Array

Problem Statement
Given a **sorted** array of integers `numbers` and an integer `target`, return the **1-based index** of the two numbers such that they add up to the `target`.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example
### Input:
```python
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
